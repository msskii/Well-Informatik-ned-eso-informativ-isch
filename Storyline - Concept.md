This is the file for concept ideas. Heres a rought Idea that i had in my head

# Intro:

While exploring the peaks and valleys in the magic mountains the MC finds a ghost town. All of the buildings are more or less a ruin. After looking around for a while, he stumbles upon an old man, gently rocking in his chair while taking a deep breath from his pipe. 
"Oh, how rare.... We do not often have travellers here. What led you to this god forsaken place?"
"I followed my intuition, i somehow felt like something was hiding here."
"Well certainly there is, or there was. This once was a booming village thanks to the large crystal mine. The townsquare was filled with people exchanging goods and children having fun. Now only whats left is a spitten image of this past."
"What lead all the people leaving this place?"
"It seems that our Gods have leaft us long ago. The mine were overrun by monsters and with our main sorce of resources gone, the village started to loose its appeal to travelers and traders. In the end only I am left here, I cant leave this place, its where I grew up and its where I will die"
"..."
"But you know, you appearing here might be a new spark of hope for this place. Here my old Sword and Pick i have no use for them anymore. Feel free to explore this place"

# Game Concept:

A dead village in the mountains, your task is to restore its glory. In the mine in the middle you can collect ores and rock. A forest to gather wood. The collected resources can be used to restore houses. If a house is restored and certain criteria is met a new NPC will come to the village and sell goods, smith new weapons, sell spells or offer other services. The first building to complet should be the trainstation as it allows new visitors. Goal is simple: Fight in the mine to get new resources, build the village to get stronger armor, weapons and spells, get further in the mine.

# Mine Concept [Needs refinement]:

The Mine should be runover by monsters. It should be dark in there, to see one needs a lantern which will slowly loose fule. Maybe you can also build lanterns and elevators to shorten the time it takes to decend. Maybe theres a way to fight the sorce of monsters.

# Village Map[To do]:
[work in progress]



# Building List[To do]:

Trainstation:
Allows new NPCs to arrive at the village 

Tavern: 
Is where you can turn in Monster meat. You can also buy food for buffs and hp restores.

Smithery:
Place to sell ore and build armor and weponary

Old Mans Hut:
First helps 





# Day-Night cycle

At first the MC will have to sleep in his tent leaving him with a [back pain] debuff in the morning.
